Linux uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to manage password policies.
You can configure password settings such as minimum length, expiration, complexity, and hashing methods,  by editing PAM modules.

Edit PAM Password Settings
      sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password

      password required pam_unix.so sha512 remember=5

## sha512 – Uses SHA-512 for password hashing (more secure than MD5).
## remember=5 – Prevents users from reusing the last 5 passwords.
