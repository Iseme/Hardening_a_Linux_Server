SSH is a common method attackers use to breach remote linux servers, it is important to harden SSH with strict controls. 

  1. Configure SSH to NOT allow the ability to 
  a. No SSH with empty passwords
  b. No SSH with root user
  c. SSH with no other ports apart from 22
  2. Enable SSH protocol 2
  3. Edit the SSH Server Config File
  4. Restart the SSH service to set your updates

To configure SSH as requested, youâ€™ll need to edit the SSH server configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config). Follow these steps:
1.	Open the SSH configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

2.	Disable SSH login with empty passwords: Find the line:
#PermitEmptyPasswords yes

Change it to:
PermitEmptyPasswords no

3.	Disable SSH login as the root user: Locate the line:
#PermitRootLogin yes

Change it to:
PermitRootLogin no

4.	Restrict SSH to port 22 only: Find the line:
#Port 22

Ensure it is uncommented and set to port 22:
Port 22

5.	Save and close the file.

6.	Restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:
sudo systemctl restart sshd

These steps will enforce the required settings: disallowing empty passwords, root login, and restricting access to only port 22.
