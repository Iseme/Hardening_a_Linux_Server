Updating system packages is important because app developers often release patches to protect from security vulnerabilities.
Having the latest version of your packages minimizes your security risks

1.	Run apt update to update your package manager to make sure it has the latest version of all packages
apt update

2.	Next, run apt upgrade -y   to update all already installed packages to the latest versions
sudo apt upgrade -y

3.	Create a file that called package_list.txt, which contains all installed packages
apt list --installed >>pakage_list.txt

4.	Identify if any of the following packages are on the list as having these could introduce a security issue:
a.	telnet
b.	rsh-client
apt list --installed | grep telnet && rsh-client

5.	If they are on the list, remove those packages
apt autoremove -y telnet
apt autoremove -y inetutils-telnet

no rsh-client package installed
telnet and rsh-client are insecure because they use unencrypted communication as well as have weak authentication mechanisms. This makes them prone to man-in-the-middle attacks.


6.	Remove all unnecessary dependencies of those packages with apt autoremove -y
7.	Add the following packages:
Install new packages
apt install tripwire
apt install ufw
apt install lynis

a.	ufw
b.	lynis
c.	tripwire
