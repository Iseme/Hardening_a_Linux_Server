Having unnecessary services running increases your attack surface.
 1. List all services and output to service_list.txt
     systemctl -t service >> service_list.txt

2. Confirm services
     grep -i "mysql" service_list.txt  
     grep -i "samba" service_list.txt


 3. Execute services
i.
systemctl stop mysql.service
systemctl disable mysql.service
sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common


ii.
systemctl stop nmbd.service
systemctl disable nmbd.service
sudo apt remove nmbd.service

iii.
systemctl stop smbd.service
systemctl disable smbd.service
sudo apt remove smbd.service
sudo apt remove samba
